Asciicasts for [Kent C. Dodds](https://egghead.io/instructors/kentcdodds)'s course, V2 Static Analysis Testing JavaScript Applications on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io//courses/v2-static-analysis-testing-javascript-applications)

## Description
There are a ton of ways your application can break. One of the most common sources of bugs is related to typos and incorrect types. Passing a string to a function that expects a number, or falling prey to a common typo in a logical statement are silly mistakes that should never be made, but this happens all the time.

We could write a comprehensive suite of automated tests for our entire codebase to make certain mistakes like this never happen, but that would likely be too much work and slow development down to be worth the benefit. Luckily for us, there are tools we can use to satisfy a whole category of testing with a great developer experience.
