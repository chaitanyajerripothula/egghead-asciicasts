## Description
ðŸš§ CONCURRENT MODE IS EXPERIMENTAL! ðŸš§

Michael Chan has years of experience with React, and in this course, he will guide you through the ins-and-outs of working with Suspense. 

React Suspense gives us a new way of describing with fine-grain controls how users experience should look based on data we have or donâ€™t have.

This will change the way you build React applications forever and this is the opportunity to get an early look and head start!
