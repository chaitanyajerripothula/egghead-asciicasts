Asciicasts for [Kent C. Dodds](https://egghead.io/instructors/kentcdodds)'s course, Test React Components with Jest and react-testing-library on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io//courses/test-react-components-with-jest-and-react-testing-library)

## Description
Shipping applications with confidence requires a great suite of automated tests to make sure that when our users get our changes nothing will be broken. To get this confidence, it’s important that our tests resemble the way that our users will use our React components, otherwise our tests could be passing when the application is actually broken!

In this course we’ll see how we can get the confidence we’re looking for without giving up maintainability or test run-speed.
