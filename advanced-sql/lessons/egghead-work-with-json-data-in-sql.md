# Work with JSON Data in SQL

Instructor: [0:00] Let's start by creating a new table called `items`. It's going to have two columns, an `id` -- that's a `uuid` type -- as a `primary key`, then `info` column -- that's `json` -- and it's going to be `not null`.

```postgres
postgres=# create table items (id uuid primary key, info json not null);
CREATE TABLE
```

[0:11] Now, let's insert some data into our table. We'll give it a random uuid for the id. Then we'll insert some JSON that will make up about this item.

[0:20] We'll say `color` is `blue`, the `weight` is `2`, `tags` are going to be an object with `department` of `electronics` and `section` of `computer`. We'll close off our parentheses and add a semicolon. 

```postgres
postgres=# insert into items values (uuid_generate_v4(), 
postgres(# (
postgres(# '{"color": "blue", "weight":"2", "tags": {"department": "electronics", "section": "computer"}}'
postgres(# )
postgres(# )
postgres-# ;
INSERT 0 1
```

Perfect. That's in our table now.

```postgres
postgres=# insert into items values (uuid_generate_v4(),
(
'{"color": "blue", "weight":"2", "tags": {"department": "electronics", "section": "computer"}}'  
)
)
```

[0:36] If you're new to JSON, JSON is an open-centered format that consists of key value pairs. You'll see it most commonly used to transfer data between the Web and a server. As you can see, Postgres accepts JSON as a data type.

[0:48] In order to insert JSON into our table, we have to use parentheses, single quotes, then open up with curly brackets. Next, we add whatever data we want and then make sure we close our curlies and parentheses at the end. To select out JSON from a table, you very simply just say `select info from items;`. You'll see here, what we have is our JSON that we inserted.

```postgres
postgres=# select info from items;
                                            info
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
{"color": "blue", "weight":"2", "tags": {"department": "electronics", "section": "computer"}}
```

[1:12] Postgres gives us two native operators to help us query JSON data. First stop is the `->` which returns JSON object filled by key. 

```postgres
postgres=# select info -> 'color' as color from items;
 color
--------
 "blue"
```

Here we're saying return the value of the color key as color which in our only row of data is blue. You'll notice that our value's in quotes. That's because it returns the value in JSON format.

[1:35] The second native Postgres operator is `->>`. This returns the value from our key as text. 

```postgres
postgres=# select info ->> 'color' as color from items;
 color
-------
 blue
```

In order to reach nested object values like we have with `tags`, we have to change this back to JSON format with the single `>` and then work with tags. Then we can use either operator to pull out the nested value key pair. 

```postgres
postgres=# select info -> 'tags' ->> 'department' as department from items;
 department
------------
 electronics
```

[1:56] Now that we understand how to access our JSON data, we can use these operators with other clauses in our query. For example, we can filter out our rows depending on their JSON values.

```postgres
postgres=# select info ->> 'color' as color from items where info ->> 'color' = 'blue';
 color
-------
 blue
```

[2:10] Another cool thing when working with JSON is we can use all of the aggregate functions built in the Postgres, as long as we cast it the right type the aggregate function needs. As we can see here, we're using the `min` aggregate function. First, we're pulling out the `weight` value out in text format then casting it into an `integer` which the `min` function can then work with.

```postgres
postgres=# select min((info ->> 'weight')::integer) from items;
 min
-----
  2
```

[2:32] If you're wondering, we have used the text operator here because Postgres can't cast JSON to a different type. Again, you can use any other aggregate functions like max, sum, and average as long as you cast it first to the right type.

[2:49] Finally, Postgres gives us some functions to help process JSON data. Here we see `json_each` which allows us to expand the outermost JSON object into a set of key value pairs.

```postgres
postgres=# select json_each (info) from items;
                                  json_each
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (color,"""blue""")
 (weight,"""2""")
 (tags,"{""department"": ""electronics"", ""section"": ""computer""}")
(3 rows)
```

[3:02] There's another function we can use. If we wanted to get a set of keys in the outermost JSON object, we use `json_object_keys`. As we can see here, we get an expanded out view of the keys within out `tags` JSON object.

```postgres
postgres=# select json_object_keys (info -> 'tags') from items;
 json_object_keys
------------------
 department
 section
(2 rows)
```
