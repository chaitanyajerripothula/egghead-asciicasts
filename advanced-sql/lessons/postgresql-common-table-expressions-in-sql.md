# Common Table Expressions in SQL

Instructor: [0:00] Common Table Expressions, also referred to as a `cte` for short, is created by using the `with` keyword, assigning it to a value, and then adding a query within parentheses.

```postgres
poastgres=# with cte_name as ( [select, delete query] )
```

[0:12] For our first example, let's say `with dates as (select now() as date)` and then we'll say `select * from dates`. 

```postgres
postgres=# with dates as (select now() as date)
postgres=# select * from dates;
            date
-----------------------------
2020-03-24 21:49:30.195956-06
(1 row)
```

Let's look at this query again. We need to start it off with a `with` keyword. The `dates` is going to be the alias we are assigning the returned value to. Inside of the parentheses, we run a `select`. Inside this `select`, we're returning `now()` as a `date`.

[0:36] Notice that we didn't end our first line with a semicolon. If we did, we would terminate the cte because they only last within the query, unlike with temp tables that persist for the entire connection to database.

[0:49] Next stop, we `select * from` our alias CTE `dates` and we see that we get date and the current time. The biggest use case I've seen cte's be used for is the ability to break out complex queries into smaller pieces. Really, almost any time you need to write a subquery, you can potentially break that out and put it at the top of your query and then reference it down below.

[1:11] My members table is intended to show the history of all of my users. The primary key here is not going to be just `user_handle`, it's going to be some combination of either `user_handle`, the `current_time` or my `start_date`. This is useful within an app that wants to show changes to a users profile over time, for example, a UI that shows that they've changed their name or their email.

```postgres
postgres=# \d members
                 Table "public.members"
    Column    | Type | Collation | Nullable | Default
  ------------+------+-----------+----------+--------
  start_date  | date |           |          | 
  end_date    | date |           |          |
  user_handle | uuid |           |          | 
  first_name  | text |           |          | 
  email       | text |           |          |
```

[1:33] This however can be tricky when trying to determine the current state of a user. How can you know the earliest `start_date` row and also the current `email` row when there could be n number of rows for one user?

[1:47] I've inserted two rows here. They're both for the same user, as you can see by the duplicate user_handles. However, their email has changed. There are also different start_dates. The earlier one has an end_date, meaning, they canceled their account but obviously came back. When they did, it was with this new email.

```postgres
postgres=# insert into members values ('2018-01-01', '2019-01-01', '57bd8cd8-7115-11e9-a923-1681be663d3e', 'tyler', 'original@gmail.com');
INSERT 0 1
postgres=# insert into members values ('2019-02-02', null, '57bd8cd8-7115-11e9-a923-1681be663d3e', 'tyler', 'new@gmail.com');
```

[2:05] My goal here is to show to the user the earliest that they signed up, as well as the most current email. In the informaorder to get tion out, we need to join the members table onto itself. We're going to do that by using a subquery that will distinct down the `user_handle`.

[2:23] Our original `select` up top is going to pull out the email from the subquery of members, which returns the most recent record for the user and then use the main aggregate function to pull out the earliest `start_date`.

```postgres
postgres=# select mr.email, min(m.start_date) from members m
postgres-# left outer join (select distince on (user_handle) user_handle,email
postgres(# from members
postgres(# order by user_handle, start_date desc) mr
postgres-# using(user_handle) group my mr.email;
      email     |    min
----------------------------
  new@gmail.com | 2018-01-01
(1 row)
```

[2:37] Don't worry so much about what this query's doing to get this data. The point that I want you to take away from this is imagine what this query will look like as we join with other tables or possibly needed to add additional subqueries.

[2:51] We could easily break out this subquery part and alias it to a cte. I've already put that all together here, so I'll paste it. 

```postgres
postgres=# with most_recent_members as (
postgres(#    select distinct on (user_handle) user_handle, email
postgres(#        from members
postgres(#    order by user_handle, start_date desc
postgres(# )
postgres-#
postgres-# select mr.email, min(m.start_date) from members m
postgres-#left outer join most_recent_membership mr using(user_handle)group by mr.email;
      email     |    min
----------------------------
  new@gmail.com | 2018-01-01
(1 row)
```

I'm just using the `with most_recent_membership`. That's what I'm going to call it. Inside of it is just our subquery, as you saw on the previous screen.

[3:07] Inside of our `left outer join`, we can reference this `most_recent_membership` cte. We're going to alias it, keep it as `mr` just like in the previous query, so that we can group by email and pull out that newest email. We're going to get the same results.

[3:23] As you can see, it's a little bit cleaner. You can see what's happening. We're breaking down the subquery nesting that's going to happen to all of our queries.

[3:32] To close, I mentioned when introducing cte's that we could use a `select` or `delete` query inside of the parentheses. That's because we could be using the returning clause when deleting items, which would return all of the items that were deleted.

[3:47] In this scenario, we're creating a new table. Within our cte, we're deleting all of the rows within the original purchases table. Then we can insert these deleted rows assigned to the cte all into the purchases_copy table.

```postgres
postgres=# create table purchases_copy (
postgres(#    date date,
postgres(#    user_handle uuid,
postgres(#    sku uuid,
postgres(#    quantity int
postgres(# );
CREATE TABLE
postgres=#
postgres=# with moved_purchases as (
postgres(#    delete from purchases
postgres(#    RETURNING *
postgres(# )
postgres-# insert into purchases_copy select * from moved_purchases;
```
