## Description
[Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) is an incredibly powerful web testing tool. It’s capable of testing any web application. Its architecture places it a cut above similar end-to-end testing tools. Its developer experience is best-in-class. And because Cypress runs your tests in the same context as the rest of your application, you’re able to get speed, reliability, and debuggability that are just a long-distant dream with similar tools. The catch? There is no catch. Cypress is exceptional.

In this course, we’ll go over how you can install, configure, and script Cypress to test modern, real-world JavaScript web applications.
