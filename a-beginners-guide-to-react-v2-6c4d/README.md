## Description
React is an incredibly powerful tool for building interactive user interfaces for the web (and native). It pioneered a component-based JavaScript-first approach that totally revolutionized the way we think about building modern UIs and is the most popular way to do so today.

This course is for React newbies and anyone looking to build a solid foundation. It’s designed to teach you everything you need to start building web applications in React right away.

Confused by all the tools of modern frontend development? You’re not alone. That’s why each lesson in this course is a single self-contained index.html file. This keeps your focus on learning React, no distractions. We’ll start with a blank file and add more complexity as we go along, wrapping the course with a lesson on how to move into a more production-ready development environment—and even deploy your app to the world wide web so you can show your friends and family what you’ve created. They will be so proud!
