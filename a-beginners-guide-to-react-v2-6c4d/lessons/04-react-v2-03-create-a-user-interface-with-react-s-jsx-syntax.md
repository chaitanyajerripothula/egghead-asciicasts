Kent C. Dodds: 0:00 Using React to create elements in this way works out just fine, but it's not entirely ergonomic. It's not the way that most of the community creates React elements. Most of the community is using JSX, which is an HTML-like syntax in our JavaScript.

0:16 If I were to create this same React element using JSX, I would make it like this. We'll say element is a div. Our children are Hello World. Then we had a className, which is a prop. That'll go as an attribute on our div here, with className={'container').

0:34 If we save that, we'll get a refresh. We'll get a white screen here. That's because we have a syntax error in our JavaScript. That's because this is not JavaScript code. This is JSX. The browser does not understand this natively. It needs to be compiled from this to something that the browser can understand. That's where Babel comes in.

0:54 Babel is a JavaScript compiler supporting the next generation of JavaScript as well as non-standard features like JSX. If we go to this Try It Out page and then go over here and copy our code and paste it in here, then we'll see that our code is being compiled to something that's very familiar to us.

1:13 React.createElement. The type is div. Here are the props, className is container, then all of the children come hereafter. I would recommend that you spend some time playing around in this tool. Understanding how JSX is compiled will make you more effective at using JSX.

1:29 In a typical application, you're going to be using a tool that will use Babel to compile JSX to JavaScript for you. For our purposes, we're going to use Babel in the browser to get this compiling our JavaScript right here without having to install any other tools.

1:44 I'm going to add a script tag here to include Babel standalone. That will compile any script tag that has the type of text/babel. Then it will create a new script tag with the compiled code with the type as text/JavaScript so that the browser can evaluate it.

2:00 With that, if I save this, we'll get Babel downloaded. It will compile our JavaScript and allow the browser to evaluate it so we can use JSX in the browser. We'll also get this warning that we're using the in-browser Babel transformer, which is not something that you'd want to do in production, but it makes it easy for us to iterate quickly right here in this index.html file.

2:20 If we take a look at the elements, we're going to see the code that we wrote in this text/babel script. Then if we go to the head, we'll see a new script tag in here which is the compiled version of our code.

2:31 In review, what we wanted to do here was make it so that we can author our UI without using the React createElement API and instead use JSX, which is an HTML-like syntax for authoring UI.

2:44 To do this, we need a compiler like Babel. We installed Babel standalone, which will compile our code on the fly in the browser. We also had to update our type to text/babel. Babel will look for all scripts that have that type, compile the code that's inside them, and insert a new script that has the compiled code so the browser can evaluate it.

3:05 In a typical application, you will not be using Babel standalone. Instead, you'll be using another tool which probably is using Babel to compile your code. That way, you get a much more friendly syntax for authoring your UI with React.
