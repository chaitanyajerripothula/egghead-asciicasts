Asciicasts for [Rares Matei](https://egghead.io/instructors/rares-matei)'s course, Thinking Reactively with RxJS on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/courses/thinking-reactively-with-rxjs)

## Description
When a manager gives us the requirements for an application feature, they don't care too much about how we build it. And often times, they think that hard things will be easy.
Dealing with time and coordinating different types of events can be tricky.

Luckily, we have RxJS to help!

In this course, you will use RxJS to build a loading spinner in an app that meets the ever-changing requirements from a mock Product Manager.

You'll also learn how to implement a "Konami Code" style feature that listens for a correct sequence of keys to be typed in a set amount of time.

Follow the thought process that Rares uses as he breaks problems down into manageable pieces that remain flexible, and become more comfortable solving problems reactively.

## Library Version
RxJS >= 6.5.3
