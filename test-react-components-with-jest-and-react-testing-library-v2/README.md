Asciicasts for [Kent C. Dodds](https://egghead.io/instructors/kentcdodds)'s course, V2 Test React Components with Jest and React Testing Library on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io//courses/v2-test-react-components-with-jest-and-react-testing-library)

## Description
If you want to ship your applications with confidence—and of course you do—you need an excellent suite of automated tests to make absolutely sure that when changes reach your users, nothing gets broken. To get this confidence, your tests need to realistically mimic how users actually use your React components. Otherwise, tests could pass when the application is broken in the real world.

In this course, we’ll write a series of render methods and run a range of tests to see how we can get the confidence we’re looking for, without giving up maintainability or test run-speed.
